# Color chooser

## Version 1: `onClick`

Create a new react app that:

- shows three components
- each component should have a color name (e.g., "red", "green", "blue")

When you click one, it should `console.log()` the color name


## Version 2: `useState()`

Create another Component that shows the color name that was clicked.
